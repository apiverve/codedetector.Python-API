```
query = a = 5 b = 6 c = 7 # Uncomment below to take inputs from the user # a = float(input('Enter first side: ')) # b = float(input('Enter second side: ')) # c = float(input('Enter third side: ')) # calculate the semi-perimeter s = (a + b + c) / 2 # calculate the area area = (s*(s-a)*(s-b)*(s-c)) ** 0.5 print('The area of the triangle is %0.2f' %area)
```

###### Simple Request

```
# Make a request to the API
result = api.execute(query)

# Print the result
print(result)
```

###### Example Response

```
